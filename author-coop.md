Coop's arteries are clogged with video games. Like every kid, he dreamed of becoming a professional game tester, and ignored everyone who said you can't make a career out of video games.

This ex semi-pro Counter Strike player used that passion along with a background in art, computer science, and music to discover that building games was his true calling. By day he rocks the advertising world as Lead Developer for Bradley and Montgomery. His nights are jammed full of writing heavy metal chiptune music, indie game development, and Rocket League.
