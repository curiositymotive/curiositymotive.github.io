Recently we asked the collective, what is the coolest thing you've worked with lately, or want to work with next? Here are the answers!

Grab a [Sparkfun Pan/Tilt Bracket](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10335), [Joystick shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9760), a couple [servos](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9065), and an [Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) and you have an awesome, fairly cheap, remote controlled pan/tilt head that you can mount whatever you like to. In my case it is a laser, but you could also mount a camera or maybe a speaker and do some interesting directional audio experiments.

I gotta give a shoutout to [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) for lighting a fire to get back into JavaScript. My journey back into development via GameMaker Studio has been pretty successful, but finding the right motivation to get even dirtier has been tricky. The bonus ended up being that as soon as I dusted off those JavaScript skills, [JS30](https://javascript30.com/) launched and reminded that I can make/break fun things that aren't games, too.

Right now I've been learning all about how synthesizers work and how to make music with them. I had no idea what the differences between monophonic, polyphonic, standalone, modular, and software synths was before but now actually have an idea of how to start making the sounds that I want to create. I even managed to learn how to use my first DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/) and get my first synth, the [Microkorg XL](http://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/korg-microkorg-xl), and drum machine, the [Korg Volca Beats](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_beats/), receiving midi data and outputting synthesized sound back into my computer. Next up expect some ridiculous tracks of my own.

Been toying around with the latest iteration of [Viget's](https://viget.com) [Gulp Starter project](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter), which is being renamed and packaged (as in [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) packaged) as [Blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid). It solves a pain point I've experienced a lot recently - "How do I share what I've learned in my latest Gulp process with all the other sites I have using Gulp?" I'm excited where they're headed with the project and want to take a similar approach in some of my other projects. I'll have a bit more to share on [Blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter/tree/blendid) soon.

This past year I took up building guitar amps. Since I don't have an electrical engineer background I've been using freely available schematics of older amps but don't have the knowledge to design or modify them. That is, until I came across [LiveSPICE](http://www.livespice.org/) which will allow me to modify circuits and hear in real time how it affects the sound. Talk about saving hours of soldering experimental designs.
